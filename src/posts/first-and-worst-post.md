## What is this all about?

Obviously, the title of this post refers to the fact that my writing should get better over time. Which is one of the goals of this blog.

I’ve wanted to write a blog for a while now. In my previous job, I enjoyed writing some findings I encountered whenever a wall was met. For instance, some unexpected (_kinda_) parsing rules for Ruby interpreter, or a weird database behavior which led to a deep investigation.

I’m an engineer by training and at my core. The art and science of engineering is one of the things I’m most fascinated about. During my graduation as an electrical engineer, I developed a passion by computing in general, and now I’m interested in learning and exploring a lot of concepts and areas. But first and foremost, this blog is for me. And maybe what I have to say will resonate with someone.

Some topics that may or may not be talked about here are (this list is most certainly wrong):

- Programming Languages
  - Rust
  - Go
  - Ruby
  - ~~Awful~~ TypeScript/JavaScript, but mostly Svelte probably
- Distributed systems (cloud, Kubernetes, infrastructure…)
- Compilers
- Operating Systems
- Networking
- Projects I build
- [Things I’ve struggled with](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/24/blog-about-what-you-ve-struggled-with/)

That’s it! See ya. ;)
