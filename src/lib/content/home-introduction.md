I’m Johann, a Brazilian software engineer with a background in electrical engineering. I like exploring how things work under the hood, and love unraveling complex systems down to the smallest node. I’ve worked with cloud infrastructure and architecture (AWS), containers, developer tools for our internal team, backend systems, CI/CD, and on. I’ve built small apps and CLI tools. I want to learn about networking, operating systems, compilers, and about building systems at any scale. I think that diving into these areas helps me learn how the world works, and this understanding opens up many opportunities for transformation.

I started this blog because I thought it would be a nice experience. I know that it helps you learn and develop your communication skills, and that’s what I want: a way to show my learnings, tastes other than a blunt resume or GitHub profile.

I like to be hands-on with learning, researching and iterating on what I’m building. I really, _really_ like to build stuff! If you’d like to get in touch, you can send me an e-mail [j.homonnai@icloud.com](mailto:j.homonnai@icloud.com), follow me on GitHub ([@murasakiwano](https://github.com/murasakiwano)), or even my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/h-johann)!
